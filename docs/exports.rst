.. module:: exports

The **exports** module
======================

CIViCpy supports exporting of CIViC records to Variant Call Format (VCF) files.
This enables downstream analyses such as integrating with `IGV`_, `VEP`_, and
other common bioinformatics tools. VCF exports are maintained via the :mod:`civic_vcf_writer`
and :mod:`civic_vcf_record` modules in the civicpy.exports namespace::

    >>>from civicpy.exports.civic_vcf_writer import CivicVcfWriter
    >>>from civicpy.exports.civic_vcf_record import CivicVcfRecord

CIViCPy also supports exporting of CIViC assertion records to JSON files, where
assertions are represented as Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Genomic
Knowledge Standards (GKS) objects. GKS JSON exports are maintained via the
:mod:`civic_gks_writer` and :mod:`civic_gks_record` modules in the civicpy.exports
namespace::

    >>>from civicpy.exports.civic_gks_writer import CivicGksWriter
    >>>from civicpy.exports.civic_gks_record import CivicGksPredictiveAssertion, CivicGksDiagnosticAssertion, CivicGksPrognosticAssertion

Other file formats are planned for future releases. Suggestions are welcome on our
`GitHub issues page <https://github.com/griffithlab/civicpy/issues>`_.

VCF
---

VCFs are written using the :class:`civicpy.exports.CivicVcfWriter` class, to
which you add :class:`civicpy.exports.CivicVcfRecord` by adding them during
initialization. :class:`civic.Variant` records can be converted to
:class:`civicpy.exports.CivicVcfRecord` records by passing in the variant
during initialization.

In order to verify whether a variant can be converted to a CivicVcfRecord object, the convenience method
``is_valid_for_vcf`` can be called on a :class:`civic.Variant` object.

Each CivicVcfRecord object passed to the CivicVcfWriter is written to the VCF file.
If two records share the same chromosome, start position, and
reference allele(s), they will not be combined into one VCF record but will instead be written
as separate VCF records. Additional CIViC data are added to the VCF as annotations to the
``CSQ`` (consequence) ``INFO`` field. All CIViC molecular profiles that the underlying variant is a part 
are identified and the evidence items and assertions linked to these molecular profiles are added
to the CSQ field with one CSQ entry for each evidence item and/or assertion. Whether
a specific CSQ entry reflects an evidence item or an assertion is determined by the
``CIViC Entity Type`` CSQ field. By utilizing the CSQ field for annotations, the resulting VCF is compatible for
import into Google BigQuery (git.io/bigquery-variant-annotation).

The status of the Assertions and EvidenceItems added to the CSQ annotations can
be controlled by the ``include_status`` parameter. Only items matching the
desired include_status(es) will be added to the CSQ annotation.

GKS JSON
--------

GKS JSON files are written using the :class:`civicpy.exports.civic_gks_writer.CivicGksWriter`
class to which you add :class:`civicpy.exports.civic_gks_record.CivicGksPredictiveAssertion`,
:class:`civicpy.exports.civic_gks_record.CivicGksDiagnosticAssertion`, or
:class:`civicpy.exports.civic_gks_record.CivicGksPrognosticAssertion` during initialization.

In order to verify whether an assertion can be converted to a CivicGksAssertionRecord
object, the convenience method ``is_valid_for_gks_json`` can be called on a
:class:`civic.Assertion` object.
